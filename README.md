## 📊 Project 1: Sales Forecasting

### What Does This Project Do?
This project helps businesses predict their future sales by looking at their past sales data. Think of it like predicting the weather - we use past weather patterns to predict future weather. Similarly, we use past sales data to predict future sales!

### How Does It Work?
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - We get sales data from a real business
   - The data includes daily sales numbers

2. **Data Processing**:
   - We clean up the data (like removing any mistakes)
   - We organize the data by date
   - We calculate daily total sales

3. **Making Predictions**:
   - We use a special tool called "Prophet" (created by Facebook)
   - It looks at patterns in the sales data
   - It finds trends (like if sales are going up or down)
   - It finds seasonal patterns (like if sales are higher during holidays)

4. **Results**:
   - We get predictions for future sales
   - We can see how accurate our predictions are
   - We create visual graphs to show the predictions
   - We save all results in files for easy viewing

### Files Created:
- `sales_forecast.png`: Shows the sales predictions
- `sales_forecast_results.csv`: Contains all the numbers
- `confusion_matrix.png`: Shows how accurate our predictions are
